# Abstract
The incidence of multi-drug resistant bacterial species is rapidly increasing. To avoid antibiotic misuse and further exacerbation of this health crisis, clinicians should obtain a swift and accurate diagnosis of bacterial resistance. Existing laboratory-based antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) methods are slow and laborious. Our study puts forward an efficient end-to-end image classification network using deep learning for predicting antibiotic resistance from fluorescence microscopy images of bacteria. Our resulting PAS-Net model integrates two parallel branches: the convolution branch (C-branch), employing ConvNeXt, and the Transformer branch (T-branch), utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT). To bridge these branches effectively, we introduce the feature interaction unit (FIU), which facilitates the integration of local features generated by the C-branch and global representations by the T-branch interactively. Additionally, we present a novel attention mechanism which reduces computational costs while maintaining the global representation capability. Experimental results, conducted on a fluorescence image dataset and public open datasets, suggest the promising potential of our method for rapidly diagnosing antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria and achieving high prediction performance.

# Getting Started
Please ensure that the dataset is stored according to the directory structure shown below.
```text
├── data
│   ├── train
│   │   ├── MDR
│   │   └── sensitive
│   └── test
```
Please ensure that your dataset directory contains two files, train.txt and test.txt, and that each line in these files follows the format:
```text 
<label>;<path>
```
where <label> is the numeric class identifier and <path> is the filesystem path to the corresponding image.

You can download our code and run the following commands:

For training

    python main.py

For testing

    python predict.py
